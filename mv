The "mv" command stands for "move" and does just what you would think, it moves a file from one location to another.
The "mv" command takes two parameters, the first is the file name that you would like to move and its location and 
the second is where it will be moved to. The "mv" command can also rename files if you do not provide a destination
for it to be moved to.
